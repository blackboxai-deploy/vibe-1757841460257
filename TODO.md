# API Request/Response Monitoring Application - Implementation Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive API testing and monitoring application with network inspection, JavaScript evaluation, and response analysis capabilities.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Structure & Layout ✅
- [x] Create main app layout with navigation
- [x] Create dashboard page with tabbed interface
- [x] Set up basic styling and theme support

### Phase 2: Backend API Routes ✅
- [x] Create proxy API route for handling CORS and external requests
- [x] Create JavaScript evaluator API for safe code execution
- [x] Create history API for storing and retrieving requests

### Phase 3: Frontend Components ✅
- [x] Build API request builder component with form controls
- [x] Create response viewer with syntax highlighting
- [x] Implement headers analysis and display
- [x] Build JavaScript console component
- [x] Create network monitor and metrics display
- [x] Implement request history sidebar

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add authentication methods (Basic Auth, Bearer Token, API Key)
- [ ] Implement response data scraping functionality
- [ ] Add export capabilities (JSON, cURL)
- [ ] Create performance metrics tracking

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build application and test all API endpoints
- [ ] Test JavaScript evaluation functionality
- [ ] Validate request/response flow and error handling
- [ ] Test authentication methods and proxy functionality

### Phase 6: Final Deployment
- [ ] Start production server
- [ ] Perform comprehensive API testing with curl
- [ ] Generate preview URL for demonstration

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] Phase 2 Complete
- [ ] Phase 3 Complete
- [ ] Phase 4 Complete
- [ ] Phase 5 Complete
- [ ] Phase 6 Complete

## Notes
- Focus on creating a professional, developer-friendly interface
- Ensure all API routes handle errors gracefully
- Implement proper CORS handling for external API requests
- Make JavaScript evaluation secure and sandboxed
